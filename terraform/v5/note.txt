Terraform modules help make your code reuseable, 
and external modules can be used to provision pre-configured resources.

What is a Module?
    A module is a container for multiple resources defined within your Terraform configuration, 
    bundled in a reusable fashion.
    Modules consist of a collection of .tf or .tf.json files kept together within a single directory. 

Why use Modules?
    Breaking down the system into different components allows for better organization and specialization within a team.
    By using modules, infrastructure specialists can define best practices for infrastructure deployment, 
    which can then be consumed by application developers without having to learn the intricacies of Terraform.

Types of Modules
    * Root Module: The default module consisting of every .tf file in the main working directory.
    * Child Module: A separate module referenced from the root module.

Modules Sources
    * Local Path: Reference a module using a relative path.
    * Terraform Registry: Reference a module from the Terraform registry.
    * GitHub: Reference a module using an HTTP or SSH link.
    * Generic Git Repo: Reference a module using a URL with a username and password.

Module Inputs and Meta-Arguments
    Child modules can also receive input variables, allowing for greater customization and adaptability. 
    Meta-arguments like count, for_each, providers, and depends_on can also be used with child modules.

Characteristics of a Good Module
    * Raise the abstraction level from the base resource type.
    * Group resources into logical groupings.
    * Expose necessary input variables for customization.
    * Provide useful and usable default values.
    * Return outputs necessary for integration with other systems.

Terraform Registry
    The Terraform registry hosts many different modules associated with various providers, such as AWS.
    These modules can serve as a starting point for your projects
    Modules allow for better organization and specialization within a team, resulting in a more efficient workflow.
